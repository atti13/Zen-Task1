### Summary
1. Developed an application to parse JSON data from an API containing information about 1000 products. 
2. Utilized JavaScript's fetch function to asynchronously fetch data from the provided API endpoint.
3. Parsed the JSON response and extracted the products array for further processing.
4. Implemented sorting functionality to arrange the products based on descending popularity.
5. Dynamically populated an HTML table with the sorted product information in a descending manner.
6. Implemented error handling using a try-catch block to manage any potential errors during the fetch operation.
