# Zen-Task1
 An application to parse the JSON from the API
link - https://atti13.github.io/Zen-Task1/
## Developed an application to parse JSON data from an API containing information about 1000 products. 
## Utilized JavaScript's fetch function to asynchronously fetch data from the provided API endpoint. 
## Parsed the JSON response and extracted the products array for further processing. 
## Implemented sorting functionality to arrange the products based on descending popularity. 
## Dynamically populated an HTML table with the sorted product information in a descending manner. 
## Implemented error handling using a try-catch block to manage any potential errors during the fetch operation.
